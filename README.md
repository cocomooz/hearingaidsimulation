Real-Time Systems and Embedded Programming Term Project


This project seeks to enhance hearing aid functionality by combining traditional hearing aid technology with a proposed new Spectral Subtraction method. The overall results of this project ultimately showed that the ISS method was not as successful as the traditionally implemented Standard Spectral Subtraction method, as it was overly aggressive in removing noise, creating an unnatural hearing effect.
